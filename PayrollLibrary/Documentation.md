Classes in the Project
The project contains the following classes:

Employee: This abstract class represents an employee in the company. It contains properties such as Id, ReportsTo, Name, Email, Mobile, and DepartmentId. It also includes a Payment property which is abstract and must be implemented by derived classes. The EmployeeDetails property returns a string with the employee's details.

Department: Represents a department in the company.

Company: Represents a company that has departments and employees.

Payroll: Provides functionality to pay employees in the company. It has a ProcessEmployees method that iterates over all departments and employees in a company, printing out each employee's details and payment.

SalariedEmployee: Represents an employee who is paid a fixed salary. This class inherits from the Employee class.

HourlyEmployee: Represents an employee who is paid based on the number of hours worked. This class also inherits from the Employee class.
